## Digital Object
An OCFL  digital object  is a collection of files and metadata that can have a notional but largely implicitly-understood boundary: “This is the thing, and this is not the thing.” An e-Thesis, for example, could be composed of a single PDF file, or it could be composed of several Latex files, a number of datasets, and a PDF file. The object should also contain a record of the metadata that describes the origin, character, and purpose of the collection of files. This might be stored in Dublin Core, METS, MARC, or a collection of several standards as needed. OCFL will not mandate the use of any particular metadata format, as this is likely to be governed by local considerations.
